Migrating between the Old Oxford Talks and the New
===================================================

Oxford Talks is about to be updated with its first phase - the editing interface, currently called New Talks.

Series and Lists
----------------

In Old Talks everything is a list.

In New Talks we make a distinction between: 

* **series** which is where a talk 'belongs' when you create it - for instance a seminar series or a conference - things you organise yourself, like your Departmental Friday Seminars, or regular Club meetings.
* **list** which is a collection of talks owned and organised by other people (e.g. All the Talks in a Department or Interesting Talks about Goldfish)

Editing Interface
-----------------

* **series** of talks will now be created and edited in the new editing interface - New Talks (http://new.talks.ox.ac.uk).

* **lists** of talks should still be pulled together in the Old Talks website (http://talks.ox.ac.uk).

.. Note:: You will need to :doc:`apply to be a Talks Editor <sign-up>` to use the new editing interface.

Updating Series and Talks
-------------------------

All upcoming series and talks have been migrated to the New Talks editing interface (http://new.talks.ox.ac.uk) so that you can edit them there.

If you change something in New Talks it should get pushed to the Old Talks website (http://talks.ox.ac.uk). 

.. Note:: This only works one way. If you change something on the old Talks website it won't get pushed to the new interface.

Series that didn't get migrated over
------------------------------------

If a series didn't have any upcoming talks we didn't migrate it. 

If the series is still current you can:

1. Either - create a brand new series in New Talks - this will appear on the Old Talks website
2. Or - ask us to migrate the old series - just :doc:`contact us <contact>` with the Old Oxford Talks web address of the series

.. Note:: The second option will keep that series connected to any other collected lists in Old Talks, with the first option you will have to add your new series to any collected lists and retire your old series

I can't see my List in the New Talks!
-------------------------------------

Is it a collected list? If so it won't appear in the New Talks editing interface as, for the moment, we are still using the Old Talks website to make collections, set up reminders etc.

Is it a seminar series or conference or similar? Get :doc:`in touch with us <contact>` and we'll ensure that you get a series set up and that it pushes to the corresponding series on the Old Talks website if that is what you want.

I've changed something on the Old Talks site but I don't see it on New Talks!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is correct. If you want to edit or add, please do that in the New Talks editing interface and allow New Talks to push the information to the Old Talks website.
