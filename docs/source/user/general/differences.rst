Moving from the Old Oxford Talks to the New
===========================================

Phase 1 of Oxford Talks  - the editing interface, currently called New Talks - has been running for two terms. Phase 2 will be released in the next few weeks and will provide ways to browse and find talks, make collections of talks of interest to you, and add talks information to your own calendar.

This will mean that we will no longer need the Old Oxford Talks, and, in due course, it will be retired. When this happens http://new.talks.ox.ac.uk will take over the http://talks.ox.ac.uk web address.

Series and Lists
----------------

In New Talks we have:

* **series** which is where a talk 'belongs' when you create it - for instance a seminar series or a conference - things you organise yourself, like your Departmental Friday Seminars, or regular Club meetings.
* **list** which is a collection of talks owned and organised by other people (e.g. Talks about Science and Art)

You have to compile lists manually and log in occasionally to keep them up-to-date. However, new talks aims to reduce that workload with a couple of automatic listings - Departments and Topics. Provided talks are tagged with a topic and an organizing department, they should appear in these listings automatically.

My Personal List of Talks
-------------------------

It should now be easy to re-create this list in the new system.

Unfortunately, email reminders are not available in this phase, but you will be able to copy or feed lists of talks into your own personal calendar.

Talks Editors
-------------

As well as series of talks, you can now make lists of existing talks.

You should be able to see your talks by department and topic as well, so you may find that you don't need to maintain as many lists (for example:- if you currently maintain a collected list of all seminar series in your department, you probably won't need to do this any longer, you can use the inbuilt filter by department instead)

.. Note:: You will need to :doc:`apply to be a Talks Editor <../talk-editors/sign-up>` to use the new editing interface.

Embedding in Websites
---------------------

Once we retire the old Oxford Talks, the templates you use to embed talks on your own website will no longer work.

Do, therefore, look at the new :doc:`Oxford Talks API <../../http_api/summary>` and the example :ref:`Talks Widget <widget:widget-index>` as alternative options. The API is already in use in a number of departments. Please contact us for advice if you are stuck.

Sending out Email Digests
-------------------------

You can get a plain text version of individual talks, series, department listings, topic listings and collected lists to cut and paste into an email or Word document.

At present, you won't be able to define a date range for the listing, so there may be a bit of deletion to do.
