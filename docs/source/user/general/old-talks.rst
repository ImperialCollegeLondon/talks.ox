Archiving old Talks
===================

The old Oxford Talks system is about to be closed down. Talks entered on that system **before February 2015** will be deleted.

If you would like to get a copy of your old talks:

1. Go to http://old.talks.ox.ac.uk/index

2. Find your list and note down its ID number

3. Type the following into the address bar of your browser substituting your list ID number for [ID number]

:: 

     http://old.talks.ox.ac.uk/show/xml/[ID number]?start_time=0

or, for a table (but not quite so much information)

::

     http://old.talks.ox.ac.uk/show/table/[ID number]?layout=empty&start_time=0

4. You can copy and paste the information on the resulting web page into Notepad or a similar plain text app.
