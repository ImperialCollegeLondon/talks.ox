Copy talks to your own calendar
===============================

You can put the details of any talk into your Nexus, Google or iCloud calendar. How this works depends on the browser and calendar you are using; we've covered some of the standard combinations here. The following steps will work for either a single talk or a series of talks.

.. Note:: Using this method, if the talk information changes in any way, the information in your own calendar **won't update automatically**. You should always check Oxford Talks to make sure that the time or location hasn't changed since you added the talk to your calendar.

Find the Add to Calendar link

The next steps depend on which combination of browser and calendar you are using:

* Click OK and don't worry, this just refers to the link back to the original talk. It will be copied over to the event notes and will be clearly visible
* Your talk(s) will be added to your chosen calendar

Using Chrome and Google Calendar
--------------------------------

* Clicking on the calendar icon in Chrome will download a file to your computer - you can usually see this at the bottom of your browser.
* The filename will be a list of numbers, letters and dashes ending in '.ics' e.g: 7545e0bc-b53c-4114-b3b7-fba953a08f74.ics
