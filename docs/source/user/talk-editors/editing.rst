#. Click **Dashboard** in the tool bar at the top of the screen to view all the talks and series you have created.
#. The column on the left allows you to switch between talks, series and people (speakers, organisers and hosts) 
#. Filters allow you to narrow the list down further

.. Note:: The default view is to show *all* future talks. You may want to restrict this to **Talks Editable by me** at the bottom of the list of filters.

You can schedule and publish a talk even if you don't have all the details:

* You must supply the **Date** and **Time**
* Leave other fields on the form blank 
* Use the **Title TBA** check box to leave the **Title** blank

Use the **Dashboard** **Missing Information** filters to identify talks with information still to be supplied:

A talk is flagged **In preparation** so that everyone is aware that the information is subject to change or incomplete.

.. Note:: **In preparation** talks are:

   * **Not Private** - all talks can be viewed if you know the web address

   * **Can't be found** through the search interface or the lists on the Oxford Talks website
