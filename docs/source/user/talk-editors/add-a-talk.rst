Abstract
--------

The talk abstract will be used for searching, so please add it if you have it. 

The abstract field uses the Textile markup language - the basics are very easy to remember:

**Headings**

::

     h1. Main Heading
     h2. Sub heading

**Paragraphs**

::

     Separate paragraphs with a blank line.
     
     This is a new paragraph.

**Bullet Points and Numbered Lists**

::

     * First Item
     * Second Item
     # Item One
     # Item Two

**Links**

::

     "Link Title":http://www.ox.ac.uk

Topics
------

We use Topics to group talks into subject areas, so assigning one or more topics to your talk will mean that it will have a better chance of being discovered and readvertised by specialist communities.

Start typing and you will be offered options from the `Library of Congress Subject Headings <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html>`_. 

Please start with broader topics first e.g.: 'Neuroscience' or 'Ancient History', and then add narrower topics in the specialist area of the talk e.g.: 'Molecular Neurobiology' or 'Naval Warfare'.
