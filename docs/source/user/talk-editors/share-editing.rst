Type in the email address of another Talks Editor in the **Other Editors** field. You will need to know the full address as this field doesn't autocomplete, however once you've finished typing the address will then appear in a drop-down list for you to choose.

You may add as many editors as you like. The **Edit** button for the Series will then appear in the other editors' Dashboards 

.. Note:: The address will only pop-up in the Talks Editor has already been signed up to Oxford Talks. If their email doesn't appear, make sure they have been signed up. For more information see :doc:`Apply to be a Talks Editor <sign-up>`.

Individual Talks
----------------

If you share editing of a Series with a Talks Editor, then they will have the rights to edit all the Talks in that series too. 

You can adjust this in the **Other Editors** field of the individual talk.

Lists

Once you have signed an editor up to your list they will see it on their **Manage Lists** page and will find the list available in the dropdown box on each talk and series page.
