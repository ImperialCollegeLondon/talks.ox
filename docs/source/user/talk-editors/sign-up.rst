==========================

To create Talks and Series (such as Seminar Series and Conferences), you need to apply to become a Talks Editor.

All members of the University are entitled to be a Talks Editor, if you are a student, please ask a member of staff to approve your application. 

There are two steps:

1. :doc:`Log in <log-in>` to Oxford Talks (this will create an ordinary user account for you)
2. Send an email to oxtalks-contact@it.ox.ac.uk with the following:

  * Your Name
  * Department
  * Your Email
  * Email address of the member of staff approving your application (if you are a student)

If you are planning to share editing with other colleagues then ask them to log in and send us their details as well.
