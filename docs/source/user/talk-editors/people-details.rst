Change speaker / host / organiser details
=========================================

Speaker, host and organiser details can be changed using the Person edit form

Be careful!
-----------

.. warning::

Any Talks Editor can change the details of any person appearing in Oxford Talks as a speaker, host or organiser. When you edit their name or affiliation, the changes will **trickle down to every talk this person has been assigned to** - including past talks.  If someone has moved department or been promoted, it is perfectly OK to create a new person entry for them in their new role.

Find the person

#. Click **Dashboard** on the toolbar at the top of the screen
#. Select the **People** filter
#. Although you can go straight to the Person Edit form from here by clicking the **Edit** button, it is a good idea to click on the name of the person first and review what talks they appear in.

* To cancel your changes before saving, use the **back** button on your browser
