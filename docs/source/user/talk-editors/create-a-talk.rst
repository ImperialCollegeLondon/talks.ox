Create a talk
=============

Get started by creating a new talk.  

The New Talk form
-----------------

   :align: center


You can get to the New Talk form by clicking **New Talk** on the toolbar at the top of the screen.

Alternatively click Dashboard and then the **New Talk** button.

The New Talk form is quite lengthy, but the most important fields are grouped at the top:

Title
-----

   :align: center


Get started immediately by typing the **Title**.

If you don't yet know the title you can leave the **Title** field blank and tick the **Title TBA** box. 

.. note::

     For more information on scheduling talks before you have all the information see the :doc:`Editing and Publishing <editing>` section of  this guide.

Start and End
-------------

   :align: center


Clicking anywhere in the **Start** field will make the calendar picker appear. Select the month and day and the picker will automatically switch to time options.

Once you have finished selecting the **Start** date and time, the **End** field will automatically be set to an hour later. You can change this by clicking in the End field.

Speakers
--------

#. If you start typing a speaker's name, you may find they are already in the system. If they aren't then, click **Create new person** to reveal the form to add a new speaker. 
#. You may add as many speakers as you like.

You will find that **Talk organisers** and **Talk hosts** can be added in the same way. Scroll down to find these fields.

.. Note:: The section :doc:`Change speaker / host / organiser details <people-details>` explains how to edit this information.

Venue
-----

#. Start typing the name of a building or location and it will be automatically looked up in the University's OxPoints system. The address and map information will be retrieved automatically and displayed with the rest of the talk information.
#. Specific details - the room name or number, or information about how to gain entry - can be added in the box below.

If the talk doesn't take place in the University then leave the **Venue** field blank and use the **Venue Details** box.

You will find that the **Organising department** can be added in a similar way. Scroll down to find that field.

Saving
------

When you're ready, save the talk by clicking either:

* **Save and add another Talk** to go straight to a new Add Talk form
* **Done** to preview the talk you've just created

If you want to cancel your changes (before you save them) then just click the **back** button in your browser.
