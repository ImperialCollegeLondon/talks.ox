An example widget to get you started with embedding talks in your own webpages can be found here:

`https://github.com/ox-it/talks.ox-js-widget <https://github.com/ox-it/talks.ox-js-widget>`_

The widget uses JavaScript to write a table, list or calendar view of selected talks to an HTML page. You can specify the criteria to select the talks you want.
