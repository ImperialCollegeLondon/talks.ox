# Solr

## Solr schema

If any changes are made to the indexing, the solr schema needs to be regenerated by using the following command:

    python manage.py build_solr_schema --settings=talks.local_settings > solr/schema.xml
    
Every time the `search_indexes.py` files are modified, the `build_solr_schema` command
should be used so that we always have the latest version of the schema in Solr.

## Development


### Using docker-compose

Following the instructions on the root README file should bring up the local dev solr instance.

### Using your own installation of Solr (not recommended)

The ``solrconfig.xml`` file is available in the ``solr`` directory at the root of the repository.

Both files (``schema.xml`` and ``solrconfig.xml``) need to be put in your core's (default is ``collection1``) ``conf`` directory.
